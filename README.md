Title: Face Recognition Security System using OpenCV
OVERVIEW:
This project is a real-time face recognition-based security system built using OpenCV in Python, designed to work seamlessly in Google Colab. It uses:
Haar Cascades for detecting faces during training.
LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) for recognizing known faces.
OpenCV's Deep Learning SSD (Single Shot Detector) for accurate real-time face detection during testing.
An alarm sound and image capture feature for unauthorized individuals.

WORKING:

Install Dependencies:
-OpenCV with contrib modules is installed for access to the LBPH recognizer.
Upload and Prepare Training Data:
-You upload images labeled like user1_1.jpg, user1_2.jpg, etc.
-The script extracts faces from these using Haar Cascades and stores them with unique labels.
Train the Face Recognizer:
-Using the LBPH algorithm, it learns the patterns of each labeled face.
Upload a Test Image or Video:
-You provide a test file (image or video) to check for face recognition.
Face Detection with Deep Learning (SSD):
-Instead of Haar Cascades, this step uses a pre-trained SSD model for robust, real-time detection.
-Faces are extracted and passed through the trained recognizer.
Recognition and Alert System:
-If a face matches a known label with good confidence, it shows the name.
-If not, it triggers an alarm sound and saves the image of the intruder to a folder called unauthorized.

 MAINUSE CASE
if live cam data given:
Offices for monitoring entry of authorized staff.
Homes to detect and alert unauthorized visitors.
Exam centers or labs for identity verification.
Banks, vaults, or data centers where access control is crucial.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENT:
Webcam integration for real-time monitoring on Raspberry Pi or local machine.
Google Drive or cloud storage for saving logs and intruder images.
Mobile app integration to alert via SMS or push notification.
Live streaming with face logs and attendance tracking.
Replace LBPH with deep learning recognizer (like FaceNet or DeepFace) for better accuracy.
Face anti-spoofing module to prevent printed photo attacks.

CONCLUSION:
This Face Recognition Security System combines traditional computer vision (Haar, LBPH) with modern deep learning (SSD) to deliver a reliable, 
real-time security mechanism. It demonstrates how simple tools and techniques can build powerful, extensible systems for real-world use.
With a few enhancements, it can scale to production-grade solutions.
